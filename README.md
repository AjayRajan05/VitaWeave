## 📌 Abstract

> **VitaWeave: AI-Powered Frontline Health Intelligence and Resource Coordination Platform**
>
> Rural healthcare delivery in India depends heavily on **ASHA and ANM workers** who serve as the first point of contact for communities. However, frontline workers often manage large numbers of households without intelligent support to determine which patients require immediate attention, whether referrals are completed, or where healthcare resource gaps are emerging.
>
> **VitaWeave** is an AI-powered frontline health intelligence platform designed to empower ASHA and ANM workers with actionable decision support. Instead of treating frontline workers primarily as data-entry personnel, VitaWeave transforms the information they collect into intelligence that helps determine **who needs attention first**, **what action is required**, and **whether that action was completed**.
>
> Through an **offline-first mobile application**, ASHA/ANM workers can register patients, record health information, monitor vaccinations and community alerts, and receive an AI-prioritized daily task list. VitaWeave's **urgency engine** analyzes patient information, vitals, visit history, and risk factors to identify high-priority cases and explain why they require attention. When escalation is necessary, the platform supports referral routing and tracks the referral through completion, helping reduce gaps between identification and actual care.
>
> VitaWeave extends this patient-level intelligence into **health-resource intelligence**. Aggregated frontline demand signals can be combined with Primary Health Centre (PHC)-level information such as medicine availability, patient footfall, bed capacity, staff availability, and resource utilization. AI models identify emerging demand patterns and provide early warnings for potential resource shortages.
>
> When a shortage is predicted, the platform identifies suitable resources at nearby PHCs and generates **explainable redistribution recommendations** based on demand, urgency, availability, distance, and safety-stock requirements. These recommendations remain subject to authorization by healthcare administrators, keeping humans in control of operational decisions.
>
> By combining frontline AI decision support, closed-loop referral coordination, demand intelligence, resource forecasting, and human-in-the-loop optimization, VitaWeave aims to help rural healthcare move from reactive care delivery to proactive, coordinated, and data-driven healthcare delivery.

## 🔄 The Continuous Coordination Loop

VitaWeave replaces fragmented paper-based triage and disconnected administrative forms with an uninterrupted, closed-loop cycle of frontline clinical intelligence and health-system coordination:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["👩‍⚕️ ASHA / ANM<br/>Identify Case"] --> B["⚡ Urgency Engine<br/>Prioritize & Explain"]
    B --> C["🏥 Routing<br/>Refer to PHC/CHC"]
    C --> D["📍 Closed-Loop<br/>Track to Completion"]
    D --> E["📈 Aggregation<br/>Understand Demand"]
    E --> F["🔮 Predictive AI<br/>Anticipate Gaps"]
    F --> G["🤝 Optimization<br/>Coordinate PHCs"]
    G --> H["🩺 Human Auth<br/>Improve Care"]
    H --> A
```

| Stage | What VitaWeave Does |
|---|---|
| **1. Identify** | ASHA/ANM registers citizen in the field with offline-first capture, multimodal scanning of existing records, and structured vital signs. |
| **2. Prioritize** | Clinical Urgency Engine evaluates physiological markers (NEWS2 + Maternal Risk) to calculate a 0–100 priority score with clinical explainability tags. |
| **3. Refer** | Automatically matches patient urgency with the correct facility tier (Sub-Centre → PHC → CHC → District Hospital) or initiates telemedicine. |
| **4. Track** | Digital tracking monitors every step (dispatch → arrival → consultation → prescription → discharge) to eliminate referral drop-off. |
| **5. Understand Demand** | Field diagnoses and community alerts are aggregated in real time across villages, wards, and administrative blocks. |
| **6. Anticipate Gaps** | Demand forecasting correlates frontline disease spikes with PHC medicine stock, bed occupancy, and diagnostic consumables. |
| **7. Coordinate** | Algorithmic redistribution calculates optimal resource transfers between nearby PHCs based on distance, surplus, and buffer-stock rules. |
| **8. Improve Care** | District health administrators authorize redistribution orders, closing the loop to ensure care delivery is never bottlenecked. |

## 🎯 Four Core Measurable Outcomes

VitaWeave measures frontline impact against four core operational metrics:

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Strategic Impact Focus
    x-axis Low Efficiency --> High Efficiency
    y-axis Reactive Care --> Proactive Intelligence
    quadrant-1 VitaWeave Target Zone
    quadrant-2 Clinical Decision Support
    quadrant-3 Legacy Paper Systems
    quadrant-4 Basic Digital Forms
    "Legacy Registers": [0.15, 0.20]
    "ANMOL / Form Builders": [0.45, 0.35]
    "eSanjeevani (Teleconsult only)": [0.55, 0.45]
    "VitaWeave Closed-Loop": [0.92, 0.90]
```

1. **⏱️ Reduced Time-to-Intervention**: Slashes the latency between identifying a high-risk maternal or decompensating patient and conducting an in-person health worker visit.
2. **📉 Zero Referral Drop-Off**: Closes the loop on specialist and PHC escalations with bidirectional status confirmations between frontline workers and doctors.
3. **🎯 Elevated Frontline Diagnostic Precision**: Empowers ASHA workers with AI-guided differential triage, increasing the accurate identification of critical cases.
4. **📊 Live Care-Gap Visibility**: Replaces static retrospective form counts with real-time operational maps showing active care gaps, pending visits, and emergent supply shortages.

- **Offline Clinical Vitals & Triage**: Capture respiration, SpO₂, blood pressure, temperature, and blood glucose without internet; score updates instantaneously.
- **Multimodal Document & Prescription Scanner**: Uses **Google Gemini Vision** (via Gemini API keys) to scan physical prescriptions, handwritten ANC cards, and lab test results, converting paper data into structured digital records.
- **MedGemma Clinical Assistant**: Conversational clinical copilot supporting vernacular queries in Hindi, Tamil, and English, providing triage recommendations and differential insights.
- **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)**: Tracks age-specific vaccine milestones for infants and expectant mothers with overdue alerts.

### 2. 👨‍⚕️ Doctor & PHC Outpatient Console (`app/(doctor)`)
- **Urgency-Ranked Queue**: Outpatient waiting lists are dynamically sorted by clinical priority score rather than arrival time, ensuring critical patients are seen first.
- **Integrated Telemedicine**: High-performance Agora video calling directly connects doctors to rural sub-centres with single-tap connection.
- **Clinical Encounter Documentation**: Record visit notes, prescribe medications, and automatically trigger follow-up home visit tasks in the assigned ASHA worker's schedule.

- **Predictive Shortage Warnings**: Early warning indicators forecasting stockouts for critical supplies (e.g., ORS, iron-folic acid, oxytocin, antivenom, antibiotics).
- **Inter-PHC Explainable Redistribution**: Automated matching engine generates redistribution proposals across neighboring health facilities based on distance, surplus volume, demand urgency, and safety stock buffers.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Governance**: Administrators retain complete operational control to approve, modify, or reject redistribution proposals before execution.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Transparent logging of all priority scores, overrides, and administrative actions.

### 4. 📱 Citizen & Patient Companion (`app/(patient)`)

## 🔒 Security, Compliance & Governance

- **DPDP Act 2023 Compliance**: Built from the ground up to respect Indian data sovereignty. All cloud data resides in Mumbai (`asia-south1`). Explicit consent artefacts are collected via `app/consent.tsx` before capturing health information.
- **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)**: M1/M2 ready architecture supporting ABHA ID generation, patient profile linkage, and interoperable health record exchange.
- **Zero-Exposure Secret Management**: Google Gemini API keys, Agora RTC certificates, and service role keys are strictly isolated in edge compute environments and never bundled in production client binaries.
- **End-to-End Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI) is encrypted client-side using AES-GCM before syncing to persistent storage.
- **PHI Telemetry Redaction**: Automated sanitization in `lib/phiSecurity.ts` strips patient names, phone numbers, and Aadhaar identifiers before application logs or Sentry telemetry are dispatched.
